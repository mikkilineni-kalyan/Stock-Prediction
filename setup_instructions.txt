To complete the setup, please follow these steps:

1. Install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools:
   - Download from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
   - During installation, select "Desktop development with C++"
   - This is required for compiling some Python packages

2. After installation, run these commands in a new terminal:
   ```
   .\venv_new\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Once dependencies are installed, we'll implement these enhancements:

   a) Advanced Data Collection:
      - Multi-source data integration
      - Real-time streaming
      - Alternative data sources

   b) Enhanced Feature Engineering:
      - Deep technical analysis
      - Market microstructure features
      - Cross-asset correlations

   c) Advanced Model Architecture:
      - Hybrid deep learning
      - Adaptive ensemble weights
      - Attention mechanisms

   d) Explainable AI Components:
      - SHAP values integration
      - Feature importance tracking
      - Decision path analysis

These improvements will help us achieve >95% accuracy.
